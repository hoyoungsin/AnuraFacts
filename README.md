# AnuraFacts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This website is to showcase organisms within the order of Anura, better known as frogs. 

## Planned Features

The site has several planned features shown below.

### `Anura of the Day`

The home page will feature one species of anura which will be determined by the day. It will show a the species name, photo, characteristics, and geographical location where the species is usually found. The species name will be clickable to lead to the species page

Another option would be a randomly selected species each time the page is refreshed.

### `Species Page`

The species page will contain more details of the species and more photos. More detais such as family and genus, estimated population, fun facts, and origin of the name will most likely be included. Will include their sound if available.

### `Anura Species Tree (Phylogeny)`

An overall species tree will be available with selectable links that lead to the species page.

### `Geographical Map`

Intergrate Map of Life for the order of Anura if possible.

### `Nav Bar`

The navigation bar is to include the **Home Page, Species Tree, Geographical Map, About Page** 

### `About Page`

Simple about page with sources of data. Include any contributer information including [AmphibiaWeb](amphibiaweb.org)

### `Contribution Page`

Depending on the legality of accepting donations, a contribution page will be available for donations and have a record of what the donations has been used for for transparency. Also have a section that lists all contributors of data and donor's with their consent.

## Back-End

The back-end of the site will need to be created containing all information for the **Species Page**. 

If contributions can be legally accpeted, back-end will be required for storing of donor information for records.
